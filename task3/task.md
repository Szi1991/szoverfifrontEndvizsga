## Hints

- You can use the VS Code Live Server extension (or any static server) to test your implementation.
- You can use the `reset.css` to create a baseline of your CSS implementation.
- You can implement the task in native CSS or using Tailwind.
- If you use Tailwind you need to build your source code, if you use native CSS, you can skip that step.
- Do not take care of the `.gitkeep` files. They are needed to keep their parent directories in git.
